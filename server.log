2013-09-11 20:53:34 [INFO] <jemmrich> i havent built too many, but basically if you make iron fence they cant get through but you can hit

2013-09-11 20:53:40 [INFO] <jemmrich> them
2013-09-11 20:54:00 [INFO] <jemmrich> so you make a room that they spawn in because of spawner, and lead

2013-09-11 20:54:30 [INFO] <OzBarry> what is the best way to auto-kill a mob?
2013-09-11 20:54:36 [INFO] <OzBarry> drowning?
2013-09-11 20:54:46 [INFO] <jemmrich> you can make them spawn in water, so they are "stuck" to the fence
2013-09-11 20:55:03 [INFO] <jemmrich> you cant auto kill because then you dont get xp
2013-09-11 20:55:21 [INFO] <OzBarry> ah, so you still have to swing a weapon

2013-09-15 16:05:50 [INFO] <jemmrich> should be as simple as doing a git clone?[m
2013-09-15 16:06:04 [INFO] <jemmrich> now :) i forgot i had a port already available[m
2013-09-15 16:06:30 [INFO] <OzBarry> awesome - yeah, i'll do that - any other plugins (other than the map one) that we should cover[m
2013-09-15 16:06:50 [INFO] <jemmrich> i dont know anything about plugins[m
2013-09-15 16:07:07 [INFO] <jemmrich> i think i have two ports, so we can use one for the map[m

2013-09-15 16:07:36 [INFO] <OzBarry> cool - if not, we can just clear the plugins directory after we clone it[m
2013-09-15 16:07:54 [INFO] <OzBarry> also, for the map plugin to work, you'll need to run launch-bukkit.sh rather than just launch.sh[m

2013-09-21 15:27:00 [INFO] <OzBarry> no idea how to, but i know it's possible to do[m
2013-09-21 15:33:50 [INFO] <OzBarry> so, i may have just built an automated rail system[m

2013-09-21 15:39:33 [INFO] <jemmrich> so we just need a bucket of lava to power it when we use it[m
2013-09-21 15:39:55 [INFO] <OzBarry> that's only with a mod :([m
2013-09-21 15:40:05 [INFO] <jemmrich> what do you mean[m

2013-09-21 15:48:02 [INFO] <OzBarry> how do you do this lava powered silliness?[m
2013-09-21 15:48:18 [INFO] <jemmrich> put a furnace inside a minecart[m
2013-09-21 15:48:31 [INFO] <jemmrich> then put coal or lava in the furnace[m
2013-09-21 15:49:03 [INFO] <OzBarry> oh, i thought it was coal only - does that work for regular furnaces, too?[m
2013-09-21 15:50:11 [INFO] <jemmrich> yup[m
2013-09-21 15:50:21 [INFO] <OzBarry> whaaaaaat[m
2013-09-21 15:50:31 [INFO] <jemmrich> lava burns much longer than coal, but you waste iron doing it so its a trade off[m
2013-09-21 15:50:40 [INFO] <OzBarry> but, when a furnace is in a cart, you can't access it like a furnace[m
2013-09-21 15:51:02 [INFO] <jemmrich> i think you can, just try coal first, safer[m
2013-09-21 15:51:27 [INFO] <OzBarry> it won't let me into the furnace - the only thing i can do is hold coal, and right click on the cart[m
2013-09-21 15:51:37 [INFO] <jemmrich> oh, weird :([m
2013-09-21 15:55:51 [INFO] <jemmrich> i found a fortress, its soo far away, going to be a huge task to make it safe...[m
